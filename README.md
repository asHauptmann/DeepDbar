# DeepDbar

This repository will collect codes accompanying the publication:
Hamilton & Hauptmann (2018). Deep D-bar: Real time Electrical Impedance Tomography Imaging with Deep Neural Networks. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8352045/

Scripts will need Matlab, Python, and TensorFlow

Note: Codes are currently being updated. D-bar reconstructions codes will follow soon.

- 26 February 2018: First commit
- 30 June 2018: Python codes for evaluation of KIT4 data uploaded. (Network too large, will be uploaded remotely)
